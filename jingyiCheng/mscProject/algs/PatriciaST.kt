/**
 * The `PatriciaST` class provides an implementation of an unordered
 * symbol table of key-value pairs, with the restriction that the key is of
 * class [String]. It supports the usual *put*,
 * *get*, *contains*, *delete*, *size*, and
 * *is-empty* methods. It also provides a *keys* method for
 * iterating over all of the keys. A symbol table implements the
 * *associative array* abstraction: when associating a value with a key
 * that is already in the symbol table, the convention is to replace the old
 * value with the new value. Unlike [java.util.Map], this class uses the
 * convention that values cannot be `null`â€”setting the value
 * associated with a key to `null` is equivalent to deleting the key
 * from the symbol table.
 *
 *
 * This unordered symbol table class implements PATRICIA (Practical Algorithm
 * to Retrieve Information Coded In Alphanumeric). In spite of the acronym,
 * string keys are not limited to alphanumeric content. A key may possess any
 * string value, except for the string of zero length (the empty string).
 *
 *
 * Unlike other generic symbol table implementations that can accept a
 * parameterized key type, this symbol table class can only accommodate keys
 * of class [String]. This unfortunate restriction stems from a
 * limitation in Java. Although Java provides excellent support for generic
 * programming, the current infrastructure somewhat limits generic collection
 * implementations to those that employ comparison-based or hash-based methods.
 * PATRICIA does not employ comparisons or hashing; instead, it relies on
 * bit-test operations. Because Java does not furnish any generic abstractions
 * (or implementations) for bit-testing the contents of an object, providing
 * support for generic keys using PATRICIA does not seem practical.
 *
 *
 * PATRICIA is a variation of a trie, and it is often classified as a
 * space-optimized trie. In a classical trie, each level represents a
 * subsequent digit in a key. In PATRICIA, nodes only exist to identify the
 * digits (bits) that distinguish the individual keys within the trie. Because
 * PATRICIA uses a radix of two, each node has only two children, like a binary
 * tree. Also like a binary tree, the number of nodes, within the trie, equals
 * the number of keys. Consequently, some classify PATRICIA as a tree.
 *
 *
 * The analysis of PATRICIA is complicated. The theoretical wost-case
 * performance for a *get*, *put*, or *delete* operation
 * is **O(N)**, when **N** is less than
 * **W** (where **W** is the length in bits of the
 * longest key), and **O(W)**, when **N** is greater
 * than **W**. However, the worst case is unlikely to occur with
 * typical use. The average (and usual) performance of PATRICIA is
 * approximately **~lg N** for each *get*, *put*, or
 * *delete* operation. Although this appears to put PATRICIA on the same
 * footing as binary trees, this time complexity represents the number of
 * single-bit test operations (under PATRICIA), and not full-key comparisons
 * (as required by binary trees). After the single-bit tests conclude, PATRICIA
 * requires just one full-key comparison to confirm the existence (or absence)
 * of the key (per *get*, *put*, or *delete* operation).
 *
 *
 * In practice, decent implementations of PATRICIA can often outperform
 * balanced binary trees, and even hash tables. Although this particular
 * implementation performs well, the source code was written with an emphasis
 * on clarity, and not performance. PATRICIA performs admirably when its
 * bit-testing loops are well tuned. Consider using the source code as a guide,
 * should you need to produce an optimized implementation, for anther key type,
 * or in another programming language.
