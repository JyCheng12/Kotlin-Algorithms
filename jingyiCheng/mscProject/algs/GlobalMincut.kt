/**
 * The `GlobalMincut` class represents a data type for computing a
 * *global minimum cut* in an edge-weighted graph where the edge
 * weights are nonnegative. A *cut* is a partition of the set
 * of vertices of a graph into two nonempty subsets. An edge that has one
 * endpoint in each subset of a cut is a *crossing edge*. The weight
 * of a cut is the sum of the weights of its crossing edges.
 * A *global minimum cut* is a cut for which the weight is not
 * larger than the weight of any other cut.
 *
 *
 * The `weight()` method returns the weight of the minimum cut and the
 * `cut(int v)` method determines if a vertex `v` is on the first or
 * on the second subset of vertices of the minimum cut.
 *
 *
 * This is an implementation of *Stoerâ€“Wagner's algorithm* using an index
 * priority queue and the union-find data type in order to simplify dealing with
 * contracting edges. Precisely, the index priority queue is an instance of
 * [IndexMaxPQ] which is based on a binary heap. As a consequence, the
 * constructor takes *O*(*V* (*V* + * E* ) log *
 * V *) time and *O*(*V*) extra space (not including the
 * graph), where *V* is the number of vertices and *E* is the
 * number of edges. However, this time can be reduced to *O*(*V E*
 * + * V<sup>2</sup>* log *V*) by using an index priority queue
 * implemented using Fibonacci heaps.
 *
 *
 * Afterwards, the `weight()` and `cut(int v)` methods take constant
 * time.
 *
 *
 * For additional documentation, see
 *
 *  * M. Stoer and F. Wagner (1997). A simple min-cut algorithm. *Journal of
 * the ACM *, 44(4):585-591.
